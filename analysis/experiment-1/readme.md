## Experiment 1: Investigating some puzzling results from the DOE meeting
  
In the results we presented at the Fall 2018 meeting at DOE, there
appeared to be some anomalies.  Most notably there appeared to be a
falloff in density near the edges of the output ranges, despite the
fact that the likelihood function contains no such behavior.

The result of this investigation was that the anomalies appear to have
been mostly an artifact of the plots we were using to illustrate the
results.  There was also some evidence of imperfect mixing in the
Markov chains, which led us to investigate longer sampling runs for
the paper.
