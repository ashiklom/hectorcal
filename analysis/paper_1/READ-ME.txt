“Calibrating the simple climate models to individual Earth system models: Lessons learned from calibrating Hector”. 

R_scripts - the directory containing all R scripts that calibrate Hector 
	The level 1A scripts launch the concentration and emissions calibration experiments. The script name describes the particular calibration experiment. 
	The level 1B script consolidates all of the converged calibration results into a single csv file that is save in the output directory to be used by the paper1_fig.R. 
	The level 2A scripts perform the symmetry calibration experiments, that calibrated the concentration driven Hector at fixed values of kappa and the emissions driven calibration experiments at fixed values of beta. 
	The level 2B script consolidates all of the results from the symmetry experiments into a single csv file saved in the output directory to be used by paper1_fig.R. 

Output - the directory containing the csv files used by the paper1_figs.R. 
	calibration_results.csv - fitted parameter values from the 1A scripts consolidated as a single csv file by 1B script. 
	emualted_Hector_output.csv - Hector output using the calibration results saved in calibration_results.csv created by the 1B script. 
	sym_results.csv - results from the 2A symmetry generated by the 2B script. 

paper1_figs.R: the R script that calculate the summary stats for the paper and generates the paper figures.
